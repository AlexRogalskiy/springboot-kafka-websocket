== Goal

The goal of this project is to implement two micro-services: 1) `bitcoin-api`: responsible simulate the BTC price changes
and push those price changes to Kafka and 2) `bitcoin-client`: service that reads from Kafka and updates its UI using
Websocket.

* We are using https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle[Spring Cloud Stream]
framework for building highly scalable event-driven microservices connected with shared messaging systems.

* We are using https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] as HTML template

* We are using https://zipkin.io[Zipkin] for visualizing traces between and within microservices.

* We are using https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki[Eureka], also known as Discovery Server, it is an application that holds the information about all
microservices.

== Start Environment

=== Docker Compose

- Open one terminal

- In `/springboot-kafka-websocket` root folder run
```
docker-compose up -d
```
[NOTE]
====
To stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes

- Wait a little bit until all containers are Up (healthy). You can check their status running
```
docker-compose ps
```

== Start Services

=== eureka-server

- Open a new terminal
- Inside `/springboot-kafka-websocket/eureka-server` folder run
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
- The link for `eureka-server` is http://localhost:8761

=== bitcoin-api

- Open a new terminal
- Inside `/springboot-kafka-websocket/bitcoin-api` folder run
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
- The link for `bitcoin-api` swagger is http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html

=== bitcoin-client

- Open a new terminal
- Inside `/springboot-kafka-websocket/bitcoin-client` folder run
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
- The link for `bitcoin-client` website is http://localhost:8082

- The gif bellow shows two users checking real-time the BTC price changes. Besides, they are using a chat channel to
communicate with each other.
